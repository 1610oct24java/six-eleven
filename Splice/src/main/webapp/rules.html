<h1>Rulebook</h1>  
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Splice is a 2-4 player game where players are sorcerers attempting to further their power by splicing the powers and strengths of various creatures into themselves. Players will fight against, and partially become, mythical creatures in an attempt to prove themselves worthy to ascend to godhood.
    </p>
    <h2>Victory</h2>
    <p>A player wins by controlling the last sorcerer to remain alive.</p>
    <h2>Turn Breakdown</h2>
    <p>Turns are seperated into two distinct phases, research and combat. During research, players can spend research points and upgrade their sorcerer. During combat, players may choose to fight creatures or other sorcerers.</p>
    <h3>Research Phase</h3>
    <p>
    The research phase is when the sorcerer controlled by the active player is experimenting and studying in their laboratory. At the beginning of the research phase, the active player gains a number of research points equal to their INT stat.  They may then spend any number of research points on the following actions, which they must perform in this order:
    </p>
    <h4>Drawing Spell Cards</h4>
    <p>The player may draw a number of cards from the knowledge deck equal to a number of research points spent on this.  They then choose to keep or discard any number of cards they drew.  Players must allocate a number of research points to drawing before drawing the cards, and after drawing they may not draw more spell cards.</p>
    <h4>Healing</h4>
    <p>The player may heal their sorcerer at a rate of one wound coutner removed per research point spent.</p>
    <h4>Researching Projects</h4>
    <p>The player may spend research points on projects by moving their research points to any of their active projects.</p>
    <h4>Upgrade</h4>
    A player can enhance their sorcerer's stats by spending research points invested in their creature research projects. Players may only enhance stats that correlate to defeated creature's favored stats. An enhancement costs a number of invested research points equal to the enhanced stat value. EX: In order to increase my sorcerer's VIT of 6, I may remove 7 research counters from any creature in my research zone whose favored stat is VIT, such as the Wyld Rat.
    <h3>Combat Phase</h3>
    <p>The combat phase is when the fighting happens, and is also the last phase of a turn.</p>
    <h4>Targeting</h4>
    <p>
    A player choosing to fight in this phase must declare their target. Any creature on the board is a valid target, as well as any other player's sorcerers.
    </p>
    <h4>Resolving Damage</h4>
    <h5>Player vs. Creature</h5>
    <p>A player randomly generates a number of successes that cannot exceed their POW stat. The targeted creatures is dealt a number of wounds equal to this number - that creature's defense stat. Should the number of total wounds on a creature equal or exceed that creature's VIT stat, the creature is dead and moved to the attacking player's research zone.    
    </p>
    <h5>Player vs. Player</h5>
    <p>A player randomly generates a number of successes that cannot exceed their POW stat. The targets sorcerer randomly generates a number of successes that cannot exceed their DEF stat. The defender is dealt a number of wounds equal to the attacker's POW successes - the defenders DEF successes. Should the total number of wounds on a sorcerer's equal or exceed that sorcerer's VIT stat, the sorcerer is dead and its controlling player loses.</p>
